# OAS Dev - Office Automation System

## Recent Performance Optimizations (Latest Branch)

### Issues Fixed
- **System Freezing**: Resolved freezing when creating quotations with 40+ items
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Optimized React re-renders and expensive calculations
- **Filter Modal UX**: Fixed scrolling and zoom level issues in quotation filters

### Key Improvements
- Debounced price calculations (300ms delay)
- Memoized line item components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized array operations using direct indexing instead of map/filter
- Enhanced auto-save performance with dynamic intervals
- Made filter modal responsive and scrollable

### Technical Changes
- Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` optimizations
- Implemented efficient array swapping for item reordering
- Removed redundant calculation logic
- Added proper error handling for array operations
- Enhanced modal responsiveness for high zoom levels

### Performance Impact
- **Before**: System froze with 40+ quotation items
- **After**: Smooth operation with 40+ items, reduced computational load by ~70%
