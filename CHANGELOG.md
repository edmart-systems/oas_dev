# Office Automation System - Recent Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the recent improvements made to the quotation system and signature modal functionality.

## 🔄 Quotation Payment Terms Enhancement

### Problem
The previous payment terms input used a single confusing number field where users had to remember:
- Negative numbers = days before delivery
- 0 = on delivery  
- Positive numbers = days after delivery

### Solution
Replaced with an intuitive two-field interface:

**Field 1: Payment Type Dropdown**
- Advance Payment
- On Delivery
- Before Delivery
- After Delivery

**Field 2: Number of Days Input**
- Only shown for "Before Delivery" and "After Delivery"
- Number input with up/down arrow controls
- Accepts positive integers only

### Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates user confusion about negative/positive numbers
- ✅ More intuitive and user-friendly interface
- ✅ Consistent experience across create and edit workflows
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- ✅ Professional payment string generation

### Payment String Examples
- "Advance payment required upon presentation of tax invoice."
- "On delivery"
- "3 days before delivery"
- "7 days after delivery"

## 🖊️ Signature Modal Responsiveness Fix

### Problem
The signature modal had layout issues at different screen resolutions and zoom levels:
- Action buttons were cut off or inaccessible
- Fixed height layout didn't adapt to screen sizes
- Poor user experience on smaller screens or high zoom levels

### Solution
Implemented responsive flexbox layout:

**Layout Improvements**
- Replaced fixed 600px height with flexible `maxHeight: 90vh`
- Used flexbox with proper flex properties
- Made header and footer non-shrinkable
- Added scrollable content area with overflow handling

**Responsive Features**
- ✅ Adapts to any screen size and zoom level
- ✅ Action buttons always visible and accessible
- ✅ Proper scrolling when content exceeds available space
- ✅ Maintains functionality across all devices
- ✅ Professional appearance at any resolution

## ⏱️ Session Timeout Enhancement

### Problem
Users were experiencing frequent automatic logouts due to short inactivity timeout, disrupting workflow and causing frustration.

### Solution
Increased automatic logout timeout for better user experience:

**Timeout Settings**
- **Production**: Increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
- **Development**: Remains 15 minutes
- **Session check interval**: 30 seconds
- **Activity tracking**: Every 6 seconds

### Benefits
- ✅ Reduced interruptions during work sessions
- ✅ Better user experience for longer tasks
- ✅ Maintains security with reasonable timeout
- ✅ Balances usability and security requirements
